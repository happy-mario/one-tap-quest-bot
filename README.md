bot quest tap one 
V1 Of my one tap quest bot V1 uses pyautogui to find and detect a certain pixel color on the mug. Unfortunately, before starting this project I did not realize that the hilt of the sword in this game is the same color as the mug, so it only is optimized 50% of the time. In V2 I will use OpenCV to detect the mug, rather than just the pixel color. V2 coming soon.
Also, put your mouse in the corners of your screen if you want it to stop, in case of emergency.
